# Wordlist-Creator

This tool will create every combination of given parameters. Its actually simple to code but i cant find any tools for take all permutation of given parameters.
For example if you give 5 parameter, this program will take permutation of 2 to 5 so you will have all options.

# Usage 

for get the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/RedK0i/Wordlist-Creator
```

After that you need to find location of code and then run it:
```
python3 wlc.py
```

Its really easy to use. Dont have complicated options.
